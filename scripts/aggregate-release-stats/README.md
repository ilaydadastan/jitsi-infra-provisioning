Running `./release-stats.sh RELEASE` will download and aggregate pre-terminate-stats for RELEASE. The results are in pre-terminate-stats/release-RELEASE-aggregates.

IMPORTANT: if the directory exists it WILL NOT DOWNLOAD. You can't just download the missing files, just get everything from scratch (the files are just 10KB per machine).
